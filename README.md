#  BulkyBook

BulkyBook is a full-stack ASP.NET Core MVC web application built for managing an online bookstore. It features an admin dashboard, customer interface, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and order processing.  

Developed as part of my internship, the project closely follows a Udemy course on ASP.NET Core MVC. It implements industry-standard practices such as layered architecture and uses Entity Framework Core for data access.
